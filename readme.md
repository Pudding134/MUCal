# MUCal

## Project Overview

MUCal is an easy-to-use, publicly available, interactive calendar system that all university students, visitors, and faculty can access through a website. It consolidates various date-based information such as academic calendars, teaching periods, university open and closed dates, and key dates and deadlines associated with the university calendar.

The goal of this project is to create an online calendar application with all the relevant information in a single location. All data is stored in a centralized database, which allows more efficient control and management of the data.

## Features

- Customizable user interface based on user needs and location (Perth, Dubai, Singapore)
- Displays information such as academic calendars, key events, public holidays, graduations, study breaks, exam and census dates
- Data entry interface for managing data
- All information is approved and managed through the interface, allowing sites from various countries to enter data based on their location

## Problems and Opportunities

The existing academic calendar is currently in PDF format and requires a contextual knowledge to be useful. Information is scattered across different sectors of the university and is presented unfiltered, which can be overwhelming and confusing to students. 

By creating MUCal, we aim to solve these issues by presenting students with information relevant to their location and context. They will be able to see all dates that may affect them. This provides the opportunity to create a more efficient and user-friendly system for managing and accessing date-based university information.
