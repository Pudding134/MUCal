# MUCal Event Management System

The Event Management System is a web application designed to streamline the process of creating, updating, and managing events across different regions. It offers a user-friendly interface for administrators and faculty members to efficiently organize events, and it incorporates features such as FullCalendar integration and Bootstrap styling.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an online calendar application that centralizes all relevant information in one location. With a customizable user interface tailored to specific user needs and locations such as Perth, Dubai, and Singapore, the system displays a range of critical information, including academic calendars, key events, public holidays, graduations, study breaks, exam and census dates.


## Project Overview

MUCal is an easy-to-use, publicly available, interactive calendar system that all university students, visitors, and faculty can access through a website. It consolidates various date-based information such as academic calendars, teaching periods, university open and closed dates, and key dates and deadlines associated with the university calendar.

The goal of this project is to create an online calendar application with all the relevant information in a single location. All data is stored in a centralized database, which allows more efficient control and management of the data.

## Features

- **Customizable Interface**: The user interface is adaptable to user preferences and geographic locations, enhancing user experience and relevance.
- **Comprehensive Information**: Users can access a variety of essential dates that affect them, including academic schedules and important events.
- **Efficient Data Entry**: The system provides a streamlined interface for entering and managing data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
- **Centralized Database**: All data is stored in a centralized database, enabling efficient control and management of information.
- **Contextualized Information**: Users receive information based on their location, eliminating the need for manual filtering and enhancing clarity.
- **Real-time Updates**: The system ensures that users are always up-to-date with the latest event information and changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed using Bootstrap, providing a seamless experience across devices.


## Problems and Opportunities

The existing academic calendar is currently in PDF format and requires a contextual knowledge to be useful. Information is scattered across different sectors of the university and is presented unfiltered, which can be overwhelming and confusing to students. 

By creating MUCal, we aim to solve these issues by presenting students with information relevant to their location and context. They will be able to see all dates that may affect them. This provides the opportunity to create a more efficient and user-friendly system for managing and accessing date-based university information.
